## Cody Wiley

I am a college student attending _New River Community and Technical College_ and studying **Cybersecurity**. I hope to someday get my bachelors, and maybe a PhD in Computer Science. As a firm believer that research should be open source and available to anyone wanting to enter the world of **Cybersecurity** and **Programming**, most of my research and practice code will be available on GitHub.
