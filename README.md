## Cody Wiley

I am a college student attending _New River Community and Technical College_ and studying **Cybersecurity**. I first attended *Fairmont State University* and studied **Mechanical Engineering** and then **Psychology**, but then made the switch to **Cybersecurity** because of my interests in security. As a firm believer that research should be open source and available to anyone wanting to enter the world of **Cybersecurity** and **Programming**, most source code will be available on GitHub.
